        <p class = "normal-text2"> Masjid Bait-ul-Karam was founded in the year 2007 and is located in Bensonhurst. 
            It has always been out goal to help others and make a peaceful environment for everyone. This mosque continues to
            make the area a better place. We hold 5 time prayers daily and Jummah prayer every Friday. In ramadan we hold Iftar
            and taraweeh as well. We also hold gatherings many times during the year, for zikar and remembering our Prophet (PBUH). It has always 
            been out goal to help everyone that is in need and provide any opportunity for the people to gain more knowledge of deen.

        <p class = "normal-text2"> As we all know, Covid has affected the lives of everyone, financially and socially. Our mosque had been closed for a long time for safety, and that led
            to the collection of very little funds.
        </p>

        <p class = "normal-text2">This masjid has continued to strive. However, due to a high rent, it has become very difficult to maintain
            the place, and thats why we have decided to move. From all the funds we have collected ever since 2007, we have decided to
        come together and with the help of more people, we can make this happen.</p>
